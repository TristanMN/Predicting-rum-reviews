Title: A challenging and complex rum that demands attention and rewards patience, especially when a touch of water is added to unlock its more subtle characteristics

This is a blend of Barbados, Guyana and Jamaican rums made of molasses, matured in second-fill bourbon barrels for three to five years. It's bottled in Scotland and non chill filtered. No sugar is added to the rum.

The rum presents itself with a deep amber hue, lingering in the glass with its thick, oily consistency.

The nose is a fascinating journey through unexpected scents. Sweet dark chocolate intertwines with noticeable but mellow licorice, while a twist of overripe pineapple adds intrigue and funk coming from the Jamaican part of this blend. Hints of cherry and caramel provide a suggestive sweetness, punctuated by an odd but intriguing note of a rubber seal in an old car. Burnt brown sugar rounds out the complex bouquet.

On the palate, this rum delivers a robust flavor profile. Dark chocolate and licorice dominate, supported by the distinctive tang of a strong earl grey tea. Oak and walnut provide a woody backbone, while nutmeg adds pleasant spiciness, pepper burns a little too much. This rum burns quite a lot despite its low 46.2% ABV. A single drop of water transforms the experience, softening the heat and allowing the nuanced flavors to shine more clearly.

The finish is long, with a subtle bitterness that lingers. A faint chocolate sweetnessâ€”like the memory of a chocolate enjoyed an hour ago that now suggests to take a gum to refresh stays for a long time. It is very pleasant.
